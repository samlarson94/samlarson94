- 👋 Hi, I’m @samlarson94
- 👀 I’m interested in building tools for the AEC Industry, cloud computing, and blockchain technology.
- 🌱 I recently graduated from the University of Minnesota's Full-Stack Web Developer Bootcamp.  Following graduation, I am looking for my first job in the development space and planning to further explore the Mobile, Cloud Engineering, and Blockchain Development fields.
- 🏗️ I’m looking to collaborate on any open source project that benefits the AEC and Real Estate industries, helps save the planet, or helps push the decentralized-finance space forward.
