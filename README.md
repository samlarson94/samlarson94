- 👋 Hi, I’m @samlarson94
- 👀 I’m interested in building tools for the AEC, cloud computing, and blockchain technology.
- 🌱 I’m currently in the process of completing a Full-Stack Web Developer Bootcamp.  Upon graduation, I am planning to explore the Mobile, Cloud Engineering, and Blockchain Development fields.
- 🏗️ I’m looking to collaborate on any open source project that benefits the AEC and Real Estate industries, helps save the planet, or helps push the decentralized-finance space forward.
